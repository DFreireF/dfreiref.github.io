You can find below a brief summary of the "working" codes which I have developed and / or contributed to.

**pySimToF** {% include icon-github.html username = "DFreireF" %}/ [pySimToF](https://github.com/DFreireF/pysimtof)

*Package for calculating the revolution frequency (and the expected meassureable frequencies in the cavities) of particles / ions in storage rings. Based on a c++ code developed by Dr. Chen Ruijiu*

**SimToFAT** {% include icon-github.html username = "DFreireF" %}/ [SimToFAT](https://github.com/DFreireF/simtofat)

*Library that extends the functionalities of pysimtof, i.e. uses pysimtof as foundation but with more methods incorporated.*

**AShortIso** {% include icon-github.html username = "DFreireF" %}/ [AShortIso](https://github.com/DFreireF/ashortiso)

*Package with specific modules for studying short-lived isomers. Mainly in jupyter, now it is being converted to modules '.py'*

**LISEreader** {% include icon-github.html username = "DFreireF" %}/ [LISEreader](https://github.com/gwgwhc/lisereader)

*Library for reading the information of the particles expected in the fragmentation simulations of LISE++.*
